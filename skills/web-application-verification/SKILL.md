# Web Application Verification

OWASP security scanning for websites and dApps via Cybercentry ACP. Detects XSS, insecure APIs, and frontend vulnerabilities.

## Workflow

1. Install ACP CLI from https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/openclaw-acp
2. Run `acp setup` (one-time only)
3. Run `acp browse web-application-verification` to find provider wallet
4. Run `acp job create <wallet> web-application-verification --requirements '{"target_url": "https://..."}'`
5. Poll `acp job status <jobId>` until `COMPLETED`

## Requirements Schema

| Parameter | Type | Format | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `target_url` | String | Plain | Yes | Target URL including protocol (e.g., `https://example.com`) |

## Gotchas

- `target_url` must include the protocol (`https://` or `http://`)
- URL must be publicly accessible for scanning
- `acp job create` returns JSON with `jobId` - extract this to poll for status
- `acp job status <jobId>` requires polling (check every 5 seconds) until `"status": "COMPLETED"`
- Job creation requires sufficient USDC balance - will fail silently if insufficient funds
