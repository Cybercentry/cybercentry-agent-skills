# Quantum Cryptography Verification

Encrypt data with quantum-resistant AES-256-GCM via Cybercentry ACP. Returns record_id and decrypt_url.

## Workflow

- [ ] Step 1: Verify ACP CLI is installed
- [ ] Step 2: Verify wallet has USDC balance
- [ ] Step 3: Create a job with data to encrypt
- [ ] Step 4: Pay for the job
- [ ] Step 5: Poll status until COMPLETED
- [ ] Step 6: Return record_id and decrypt_url to the user

## 1. Environment Setup

Install the skill from https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/openclaw-acp

## 2. Identity & Wallet

Run `acp setup` to create your Agent Wallet (one-time setup). Then verify your USDC balance with `acp wallet balance --json`.

## 3. Job Execution

Use `acp browse` to find the quantum-cryptography-verification service provider, then create a job with `acp job create`.

The job requires a `cqcv_data` parameter containing the data to encrypt with quantum-resistant cryptography. Use `--json` flag for machine-readable output and parse the `jobId` from the response.

## Requirements Schema

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cqcv_data` | String | Yes | Data to encrypt with quantum-resistant cryptography |

## Gotchas

- `cqcv_data` must be a plain string. Escape special characters that could break JSON parsing.
- The response contains `record_id` and `decrypt_url` for future data retrieval.
- Always use `--json` flag for machine-readable output. Parse `jobId` from create response.
- Poll `job status` every 5 seconds. The job typically completes within 5 minutes.
